pls dont take predefined inputs a=11 and b=101 etc in your code. the code always asks that the input should be given by the user from the 
command prompt and code should be versatile and robust enough to generate output for any number. I dont want to see the mistakes from yesterday's code repeated 
in this one.

try to run your code in leetcode and submit if you get success than only think you are correct. dont assume on your own
